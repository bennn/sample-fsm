A Finite-state Simulation of Social-science Games
=================================================

This is the object-oriented version of the finite-state simulation of
interacting automaton. 

My goal is o explore (1) the performance of an object-oriented version
versus a mostly functional one and (2) the gradual-typing performance
hypothesis for object-oriented programming.
