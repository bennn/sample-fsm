# sample-fsm

finite state automata playing a repeated game.


;; =============================================================================
;; This version differs from Chi's in a couple of aspects:
;; -- it does not preserve the starting state over cycles
;; -- it does not preserve the starting state when automata are cloned
;; =============================================================================
